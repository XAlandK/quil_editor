Everything (HTML, CSS, JS) is included in a single HTML file — no external setup needed.

## 💡 How to Use
1. Open the file `Quil_Editor.html` in your browser.
2. Type or paste text into the editor.
3. Switch between **“Delta”** and **“HTML Code”** tabs to view the outputs.
4. Click **“Insert Image by URL”** to embed an online image into your text.
5. Copy the HTML output for use in your own web pages or CMS.

## 🧠 Technical Notes
- Uses **Quill 2.0.3 CDN** (Snow theme)
- Automatically removes unwanted class attributes from HTML output for cleaner results
- Each block’s text direction (`dir="rtl"` or `dir="ltr"`) is detected and added automatically
